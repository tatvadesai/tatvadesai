# Bonjour! I am Tatva

A business undergrad. Currently preparing for CAT along with various things ;)

[you can find me here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatva-desai-9b5782224/)

I love to read and read and read. I occasionally write too.

I think this pretty much sums it up:

>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build >a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a >computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.


I blogged when I prepared for IPMAT. Got AIR 345 and bombed the interview. [Read it here]( tatvadesai.blogspot.com)
